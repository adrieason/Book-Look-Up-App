# About the App

This is a static app, that works as a starter point for my bigger "Classroom Library App". This application is simple. You input any ISBN from the back of anybook. The output is the title, author and book cover of that book!  

Here is a link to the website: []

# Lessons Learned
I learned that you can nest a fetch inside of a fetch. Something interesting about the Open Library API is that it does not give you the author's name in the book api. It gives you an ID that is related to each author. I learned how to convert this to the authors name, by using a different API, within the fetch!
